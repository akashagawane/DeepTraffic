# DeepTraffic
This is my initial submission for [MIT 6.S094: Deep Learning for Self-Driving Cars (2018)](http://selfdrivingcars.mit.edu/) course project on Deep Learning

### Result
With this I got speed ~70 (69.95). But the submission is random in nature. So the same submission may vary about ~2.5 mph. So try multiple times.
